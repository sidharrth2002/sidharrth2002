### Hi there, I'm Sidharrth ðŸ‘‹

I hold an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Cambridge (Distinction), and a First-Class Honours degree in Computer Science from Multimedia University, where I graduated top of my class.

My interests lie at the intersection of biology and machine learning, with a focus on representation learning. Previously, I worked on large-scale data and platform engineering at MoneyLion.
